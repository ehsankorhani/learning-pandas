# Learning Pandas

**Pandas** is a data analysis library for the *Python*.<br>
Pandas is a tool for data wrangling or munging. It is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, reading, aggregation, and visualization.

It take data in a CSV or TSV file or a SQL database and create a Python object with rows and columns called a data frame. The data frame is very similar to a table in statistical software, say Excel or SPSS.

Below is a list of things that can be achieved using Pandas:
* Indexing, manipulating, renaming, sorting, merging data frame
* Update, Add, Delete columns from a data frame
* Impute missing files, handle missing data or NANs
* Plot data with histogram or box plot

## Get a sample data to work with

Stack Overflow survey can be good sample to start learning analysis.

Browse to:

And download a Zip file for any year and extract it in your machine.

## Install Pandas (on Virtual Environment)

Create a new environment:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv pandas_env
```

And activate it:

```bash
$ source pandas_env/bin/activate
```

Install Pandas:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

<br>

## Jupyter Notebook
It's not a necessity to have Jupyter Notebooks. But it allows to see data more easily in the browser.

Install jupyter with:

```bash
$ pip install jupyterlab
```

And run it in a separate terminal - with the same virtual environment. Because the Jupyter will run as long as the terminal is active.:

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

In the browser app, create a new Python3 Notebook.<br>
Give it a name (instead of Untitled).

<br>

We are ready to use **Pandas**.
